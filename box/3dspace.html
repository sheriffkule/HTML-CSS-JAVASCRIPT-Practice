        <h2>Our Solar System</h2>
        <p>
          The solar system consists of the Sun and the objects that orbit it,
          either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun
          directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder being
          smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.
          The solar system also includes comets, asteroids, meteoroids,
          interplanetary dust, and gas. The Sun contains 99.86% of the mass in
          the solar system, with Jupiter containing most of the remaining mass.
          The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,
          consist largely of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant
          planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The
          two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, consisting mainly of
          hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune,
          are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively
          high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called
          volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane.

          <h3>Did You know?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A day on Venus is longer than its year. It takes Venus about 243
              Earth days to rotate once but only about 225 Earth days to orbit
              the Sun.</li>
            <li>Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets. It completes a
              rotation in just about 10 hours.</li>
            <li>Neptune was the first planet to be discovered through 
              mathematical predictions rather than direct observation.</li>
            <li>Saturn is the least dense planet in our solar system. It could
              float in water if there were a bathtub big enough to hold it!</li>
            <li>Earth is the only planet not named after a god. The name comes
              from the Old English word 'ertha' and the Anglo-Saxon word
              'eor(th)e', both meaning ground or soil.</li>
            <li>Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, causing it to have extreme
              temperature fluctuations, from -173°C at night to 427°C during the
              day.</li>
            <li>Uranus rotates on its side, making its axis nearly parallel to
              the plane of the solar system. This unique tilt causes extreme
              seasonal variations.</li>
            <li>Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons,
              which is about 13.6 miles (22 kilometers) high, nearly three times
              the height of Mount Everest.</li>
            <li>The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter contains millions of
              rocky bodies, remnants from the early solar system that never
              formed into a planet.</li>
            <li>Pluto, once considered the ninth planet, is now classified as a
              dwarf planet. It has a heart-shaped glacier that is the size of 
              Texas and Oklahoma combined.</li>
            <li>The Sun's gravity holds the solar system together, keeping 
              everything from the largest planets to the smallest particles of
              debris in orbit around it.</li>
            <li>Comets are often referred to as "dirty snowballs" because they 
              are made of ice, dust, and rocky material. When they get close to
              the Sun, they develop glowing comas and tails.</li>
            <li>The Kuiper Belt, located beyond Neptune, is a region filled with 
              icy bodies and dwarf planets, including Pluto.</li>
            <li>The Oort Cloud is a theoretical cloud of icy objects that is 
              believed to surround the solar system at a distance of up to 100,000
              astronomical units (AU) from the Sun.</li>
            <li>Solar eclipses occur when the Moon passes between the Earth and 
              the Sun, temporarily blocking the Sun's light.</li>
            <li>The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the 
              upper atmosphere of the Sun, which can affect space weather and 
              create phenomena like the auroras on Earth.</li>
            <li>Each planet has its own unique set of moons, with Jupiter having 
              the most at 79 known moons.</li>
            <li>The Great Red Spot on Jupiter is a massive storm that has been 
              raging for at least 400 years.</li>
